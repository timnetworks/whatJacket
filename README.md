## Features

*   Fetches **hourly forecast data** for the immediate future from the NOAA/NWS API.
*   Geocodes US ZIP codes to latitude/longitude using the Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) API.
*   Suggests clothing items based on:
    *   **Temperature Bands:** Defined ranges (e.g., Hot, Mild, Cold, Frigid) based on current temperature.
    *   **"Feels Like" Temperature:** Displayed for user context.
    *   **Weather Conditions:** Identified using keywords (rain, snow, sunny, windy, severe, etc.) from the forecast text.
    *   **Wind Speed:** Used for flags and specific item logic (e.g., umbrella usability).
    *   **Precipitation Probability:** Used for selecting appropriate rain/snow gear.
    *   **Selected Activity Category:** Filters items suitable for Casual, Hiking, Professional, etc.
    *   **Item Properties:** Considers `thermal_value`, `water_resistance`, `wind_resistance`, `sun_protection`, `special_conditions` defined for each clothing item.
*   **Layered Outfit Suggestions:** Selects a base layer, bottoms, footwear, and appropriate mid/outer layers and accessories based on conditions.
*   **Prioritization Logic:** Favors condition-specific gear (raincoats in rain, windbreakers in wind) and thermally appropriate items. Includes specific logic (e.g., mandatory undershirt for Professional dress shirts).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Displays results with item images, current conditions summary, and forecast details.
    *   Features a dynamic background image based on the primary weather condition.
    *   Includes a Fahrenheit/Celsius toggle.
    *   Vertically stacked form elements for improved usability across devices.
    *   Automatically hides the main input form when results are displayed.
    *   Provides a "Change Activity" form on the results page for quick updates.
*   **Persistence:** Remembers the last used ZIP code, activity category, and temperature unit using PHP sessions.
*   **Debug Tools:** Includes separate pages (`clothing-debug.php`, `outfit-simulator.php`) for inspecting clothing items and simulating outfit generation under various conditions.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP (7.4+ recommended)
*   **Frontend:** HTML and CSS
*   **APIs:**
    *   **NOAA/NWS Weather API** (api.weather.gov) for forecast data.
    *   **Nominatim Geocoding API** (nominatim.openstreetmap.org) for ZIP code lookup.

## Data Sources & Terms

*   **Weather Data:** Provided by the [NOAA/NWS API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). Requires adherence to their Terms of Service, including the use of a **valid User-Agent** identifying your application and contact information (see `config.php`). **Failure to provide a valid User-Agent may result in your access being blocked.**
*   **Geocoding Data:** Provided by [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) data. Requires attribution as per the [Nominatim Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/). This attribution is automatically included in the site footer.

**This application attempts full compliance with the terms of service for both APIs.**

## Setup

1.  Clone or download this repository to your web server.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/timnetworks/whatJacket.git
    ```
2.  Ensure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is configured to run PHP. The script uses `file_get_contents` with stream contexts for API calls, which typically requires `allow_url_fopen = On` in your `php.ini`. If this is disabled for security reasons, you might need to refactor API calls to use the `php-curl` extension.
3.  Place the project files (`index.php`, `functions.php`, `config.php`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `*.php` debug pages, `img/` directory, etc.) in your web server's document root or a suitable subdirectory.
4.  **IMPORTANT:** Open `config.php` and **update the `API_USER_AGENT` constant** with your *actual* application name/version and contact information (email or website) as required by the NOAA API terms.
    ```php
    // Example - REPLACE WITH YOUR DETAILS:
    define('API_USER_AGENT', 'MyWhatJacketFork/1.0 (myemail@example.com; https://mywebsite.com/whatjacket)');
    ```
5.  Make sure the `img/` directory structure exists (`img/backgrounds/`, `img/icons/`) and contains the image files referenced in `config.php`. Check file permissions if images are not loading. Create a default placeholder image at `img/placeholder.png`.
6.  Access the `index.php` file via your web browser.

## Configuration (`config.php`)

Most application settings are controlled within `config.php`:

*   `API_USER_AGENT`: **Must** be set correctly for NOAA API compliance.
*   `NOAA_API_BASE_URL`, `GEOCODING_API_BASE_URL`: API endpoints.
*   `APP_VERSION`, `APP_TITLE`, `APP_NAME_SHORT`, `APP_URL`: Basic application info.
*   `LOGO_IMAGE_PATH`, `OG_IMAGE_PATH`: Paths to branding images.
*   `DEFAULT_TEMP_UNIT`, `DEFAULT_CATEGORY`: User defaults.
*   `THEME_COLOR`, `BACKGROUND_COLOR`: PWA theme settings.
*   `CATEGORIES`: Defines available activity categories, their labels, and icons (text/emoji and image path).
*   `TEMP_BANDS`: Defines temperature ranges (in C and F) and assigns a base `target_thermal_score` (used implicitly by selection logic).
*   `CONDITION_KEYWORDS`: Keywords used to identify weather conditions from forecast text.
*   `CONDITION_THRESHOLDS`: Values like `WINDY_THRESHOLD_MPH`, `RAIN_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD`, `UMBRELLA_MAX_WIND_MPH`.
*   `FOOTER_LINKS`: Links displayed in the footer.
*   `FORECAST_BACKGROUNDS`: Mapping of primary condition keys to background images.
*   `SIMPLE_CONDITION_DISPLAY`: User-friendly names for primary weather conditions.
*   `TYPE_TO_DISPLAY_GROUP_MAP`: Maps clothing item types to display sections (Tops, Bottoms, etc.).
*   `CLOTHING_ITEMS`: The core database of clothing items. Each item defines:
    *   `name`, `type`, `layer`, `category`.
    *   `temp_bands`: Array of temperature bands where the item is suitable.
    *   `thermal_value`: Approximate warmth score (0=none, 4=very heavy). Used for sorting/prioritization.
    *   `water_resistance`, `wind_resistance`, `insulation`, `breathability`, `sun_protection`.
    *   `special_conditions`: Array of condition keys (e.g., 'rainy', 'windy') required or preferred for this item.
    *   `img`, `img_fallback`: Paths to image assets. **Ensure these paths are correct relative to `index.php`.**

## Debug Pages

*   **`clothing-debug.php`:** Displays a grid of all items defined in `CLOTHING_ITEMS`, showing their properties and checking the status (OK, Warning, Error) of their primary and fallback image files.
*   **`outfit-simulator.php`:** Allows you to manually select a temperature band, activity category, and specific weather conditions (windy, rainy, sunny, etc.) to test the output of the `select_clothing()` function and see the generated outfit. Includes the simulated forecast data used for the test.
